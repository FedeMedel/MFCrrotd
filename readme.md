# MyFly Club Route of the Day Bot

This project provides a Discord bot that publishes a randomly generated "route of the day" from [MyFly Club](https://play.myfly.club). The bot looks for airport pairs with available itineraries, formats the results into a text report, and posts them to a configured Discord channel every 24 hours.

## Features

- Queries the MyFly Club API endpoints including route search and research data.
- Configurable minimum airport size filter (default: 3).
- Displays comprehensive route information:
  - Distance between airports
  - Runway restrictions
  - Population data
  - Income per capita (PPP)
  - Country relationships and affinities
  - Flight type (International/Domestic)
  - Direct demand statistics
- Shows country flag emojis next to airport names
- Highlights best deals based on price and popularity
- Detailed itinerary information including:
  - Carrier and flight codes
  - Aircraft types
  - Flight duration
  - Amenities (meals, IFE, wifi, etc.)
  - Pricing
- Supports a `--once` CLI flag for testing

## Requirements

Python 3.12 or later is recommended. Install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Configuration

The bot automatically loads configuration from a `.env` file if it exists, or from environment variables:

Create a `.env` file in the project root:
```
# Discord Bot Configuration
DISCORD_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token_here
DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID=your_channel_id_here

# Airport Selection
MIN_AIRPORT_SIZE=3  # Minimum size of airports to include (1-5)

# Logging
LOG_LEVEL=INFO  # DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL
```

Configuration options:
- `DISCORD_TOKEN`: Discord bot token
- `DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID`: Numeric ID of the channel where updates should be posted
- `MIN_AIRPORT_SIZE`: Minimum airport size to consider (1-5, defaults to 3)
- `LOG_LEVEL`: Python logging level (defaults to INFO)

All settings can be overridden via command-line arguments.

You can also provide the token and channel ID via command-line arguments to override the `.env` file.

## Running locally

With a `.env` file configured:

```bash
# Test the bot (generates route and sends to Discord)
python -m myfly_bot.bot --once

# Start the Discord bot (posts every 24 hours)
python -m myfly_bot.bot
```

With command-line arguments (overrides `.env` file):

```bash
# Test with specific settings
python -m myfly_bot.bot --once --token <TOKEN> --channel <ID> --min-airport-size 4

# Start bot with specific settings
python -m myfly_bot.bot --token <TOKEN> --channel <ID> --min-airport-size 4
```

Once connected, the bot posts every 24 hours starting from when it connects.
